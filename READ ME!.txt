-If you are downloading the Alumni-Tracker respository from github directly,
then ensure that the downloaded file is renamed to 'Alumni-Tracker' else it 
would not run properly.

-Also the css,images and js folders are in the root folder. See the login and 
registration view files for an understanding of how those folders are referenced.
